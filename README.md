# Extracting Social Determinants of Health from Electronic Health Records using Natural Language Processing

Currently, meaningful clinical data is lost within unstructured sequential data in electronic health records (EHRs). We propose training natural language processing (NLP) models on EHRs containing doctorsâ€™ notes of their diagnosis and patients' conversations to uncover hidden word associations with social determinants of health (SDoH), and specifically food insecurity.
